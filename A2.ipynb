For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) and Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`, that you used for the first two assignments.    You will also use the same definition of PMI that was used for [Assignment 1](https://roegiest.com/bigdata-2019w/assignment1-431.html).\n",

Before going on, execute that code (by selecting the cell and hitting 'return' while holding down the shift key).   It will take a few seconds to run, and will produce no output."

    "\n",
    "*Then, filter() as a transformation returns a new dataset formed by selecting those elements of the source on which function inside() returns true. In inside(), two random floats $x,y$ are generated uniformly in the semi-open range [0.0, 1.0). And if $x*x + y*y < 1$ the fuction returns true. Actually, filter() does not compute its results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to the base dataset. The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*When code executes count(), Spark breaks the computation into tasks to run on separate machines, and each machine runs both its part of the filter() to generate the new dataset which satisfies that corresponding function inside() returns true and count() as an action which returns the number of elements in the dataset. Spark returns only its answer to the driver program.*\n",

    "*Finally, we can get how much the area of $\\frac{1}{4}$circle whose radius is 1 accounts for of the area of the square whose side length is 1 by calculating $\\frac{count}{100000000}$. This number is equal to the area of $\\frac{1}{4}$circle whose radius is 1, which is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi$. By this, we can get the value of $\\pi$.*"
